# JustMobileGame

JustMobileGame is a mobile game I created to distract myself when I'm waiting for something.

It is a game of infinite raining red bullets in which the player has to survive as long as possible to score the most points.

In the end (when the player die) there is a leaderboard with everyone scores.

I also implemented powerups :

- Size decrease.
